# Laravel 5.6 + CoreUI Admin Bootstrap Template VueJS


## What is this?

A clean install of Laravel 5.5 with the [CoreUI Full Bootstrap Admin Template VueJS Version](https://github.com/mrholek/CoreUI-Free-Bootstrap-Admin-Template) added in. This implementation is nowhere near to perfect but it's a working start. Pull Requests are welcome!


## What's it look like?

[Here's a demo of the CoreUI theme running.](https://coreui.io/demo/)


## Getting Started

If your here, you most likely know what Laravel is and hopefully how to get up and running with it. If not, [click here to check the docs on getting up and running](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/). Also [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) is a fantastic resource for getting up to speed with everything Laravel from pretty much any version.


## Head Up

The version of the CoreUI theme that get's installed is not the latest version right now as the author's are re-structuring the repo to just be the free HTML template and then seperating each version (Angular, VueJS, React, etc) into their own repos. At this time the VueJS version has not been released.
